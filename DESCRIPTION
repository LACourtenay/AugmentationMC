Title: Monte Carlo based tools and algorithms for Data Augmentation
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Lloyd", "Courtenay", email = "ladc1995@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This library provides a set of functions for the implementation of Monte Carlo
    based algorithms for the augmentation of both qualitative and quantitative data.
    This includes a series of Monte Carlo simulation functions, as well as an implementation
    of a Metropolis-Hastings variant of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with
    a series of functions for the evaluation of chains.
